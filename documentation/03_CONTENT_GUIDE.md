### Our Story Section
**Heading:** How Univy Started

**Content:**
College Tech - Univy was born from firsthand experience with broken campus systems. As students and Student Cell members ourselves, we've experienced:

- Important notices lost in 300+ member WhatsApp groups
- Manual attendance marking eating class time
- Excel sheets crashing before bulk emails
- Students missing opportunities because of poor communication

We realized colleges needed a modern, student-friendly digital workspace. Not a complex ERP that nobody wants to use, but a daily-use platform designed for how students and faculty actually work.

Started with our own college as the first test case. Today, we're building the platform we wish we had.
