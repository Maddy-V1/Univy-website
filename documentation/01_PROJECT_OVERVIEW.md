## 2. The Problem We're Solving

### Current Reality in Indian Colleges

Most colleges operate with:
- **WhatsApp groups** for official notices (300+ member chaos)
- **Manual attendance systems** (paper registers, Excel sheets)
- **No centralized student database** (scattered across departments)
- **Unstructured Student Cell operations** (manual email lists, Word/Excel for everything)
- **Disconnected processes** (PDFs for forms, physical submissions)
- **No transparency** (students miss opportunities, unclear processes)

### Pain Points by Stakeholder

**Students:**
- Miss important announcements in WhatsApp chaos
- No visibility into attendance until it's too late
- Manual form submissions (bonafide, ID cards)
- Unaware of campus opportunities
- No single source of truth for college information

**Faculty:**
- Waste class time marking attendance manually
- No efficient way to reach all students
- Redundant data entry across systems
- Poor communication channels

**Student Cells:**
- Maintain email lists manually in Excel
- Create CR lists in Word/Excel repeatedly
- No centralized student database
- Manual event management
- Hours spent on administrative tasks

**Administration:**
- No oversight of campus operations
- Can't track student engagement
- Manual workflow approvals
- No data for decision-making
- Heavy dependency on physical processes

### The Core Issue
**There is no modern, modular, college-first software that handles day-to-day college operations cleanly.**

Existing solutions are either:
- Generic ERP systems (complex, expensive, nobody uses)
- Individual tools (attendance app, notice board - disconnected)
- Outdated systems from 2000s (not mobile-friendly, poor UX)
